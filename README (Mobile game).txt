Bomb Squad is a fast-paced mobile game where you compete with friends to see who gets blown up first.
This game is all about swiping through different panels with buttons on them and pressing the ones that correspond to other players.

Each player associates with a bomb of a certain color- that color is shown by one of the buttons on each panel.
While one or more buttons of the player's color is pressed down, their bomb timer will decrease- the more buttons pressed down, the faster it goes.
Note that only one button can be pressed down for each panel, so pressing a button down on a panel will reset the panel's previous button.
The goal is to avoid having your bomb timer reach 0, and to force other players' bombs to explode first.

In terms of connectivity with other devices, the game can connect between multiple Android devices, and even between PC and Android.

Thanks to time constraints (it being finals week), we weren't able to implement more than 1 panel, which defeats the purpose, but the concept is still there.
There were a few other features we weren't able to implement, but that means we got to experience what many AAA developers deal with.
